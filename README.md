# 2d-raytracing
Ray tracing, but in 2D!
I was using this concept of using raycasts to simulate a ray traced environment in 2d, but later abandoned the project when I discovered that 2d lights in a forward 2d renderer (in URP) gave the same look much more efficiently.<br><br>

A [game](https://makra.itch.io/two-opposites) that used this concept!
